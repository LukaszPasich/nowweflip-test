                <p>Each player has 10 cards:</p>

                <img class="img-how-mobile" src="assets/images/each-player-cards-mobile.png" alt="Each player has 10 cards">
                <p>Cards are randomly placed face-down.
                Players take turns, flipping face-up 2 cards at the time, trying to find <span class="text-bold">matching pairs</span> and eliminating other player’s cards in a “Rock, Paper, Scissors” style match.
                </p>
                <p>The matching pair is 2 cards that meet the following conditions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cards are in different colours (red and green).</li>
                    <li>Cards have different symbols (ex. Rock and Paper).</li>
                    <li>None of the cards is an X card.</li>
                </ol>

                </figure>
                <p>2 cards that don’t meet the above conditions is called a neutral pair.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Flipping the matching card pair makes the 2 cards battle and the <span class="text-bold">winning card</span> is determined according to the “Rock, Paper, Scissors” rules (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, Paper beats Rock).
                The winning card stays in the game, the <span class="text-bold">loosing card</span> is removed. In case of neutral card pair there is a draw and both cards stay in the game.
                </p>
                <p>When an active player flips a matching pair of cards and their card is the loosing card - that card is still removed from the game.
                Therefore players need to be careful on their turns, not to draw a loosing pair.
                On their turn players can flip only 2 cards. Player’s turn does not continue after successfully finding a winning pair.
                </p>
                <p>The player panel helps to keep track of the cards lost by each player.</p>

                    <figcaption>Example: Green lost 2 x Paper cards and 1 x Rock card.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>There are two <span class="text-bold">X cards</span> in the game, one in each player’s colour.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img class="img-how-desktop" src="assets/images/xcard-desktop.png" alt="X cards">
                    <img class="img-how-mobile" src="assets/images/xcard-mobile.png" alt="X cards">
                </figure>
                <p>A player’s X card gets activated once the 3rd card in one suit is lost.
                The X card becomes then an extra (4th) card in that suit and it’s marked with a little ‘x’ beside it, to indicate that this is a <span class="text-bold">converted X card</span>.
                The converted X card behaves like the card of the suit it has been converted to, so for ex. if it is a Rock, it defeats the Scissors and loses to Paper.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img class="img-how-desktop" src="assets/images/red-turnsx-desktop.png" alt="Red X becomes paper">
                    <img class="img-how-mobile" src="assets/images/red-turnsx-mobile.png" alt="Red X becomes paper">
                    <figcaption>Example: Red lost 3 x Paper cards. Red X becomes the red Paper.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>The purpose of the converted X card is to be a neutral card early in the game (creating accidental or deliberate draws), and when converted - to give a player,
                    who lost their full suit of cards too early in the game, an extra opportunity to continue battling with that suit.
                </p>
                <p><span class="text-bold">The objective of the game is to remove 2 full suits of cards of the opponent.</span> The first player to do it <span class="text-bold">wins the game.</span></p>
